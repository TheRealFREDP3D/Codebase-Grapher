# Codebase-Grapher v0.2 - PHASE 1

## A solid foundation for the rest of the project

1. **Directory Traversal:**  Recursively find all Python files within a project directory.  
2. **AST Parsing:** Parse the Python source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  
3. **Information Extraction:** Extract the key elements:  
    * Module/File Level: Filename/path  
    * Class Definitions: Class names and method names.  
    * Function Definitions (Top-Level): Function names.  
    * Imports: Imported modules.  
4. **Structured Listing Output:**  Output the extracted information in a JSON format.  

I will try to document my work as much as possible with the code, explanations, for each step.  
My plan is to do one small step at a time and to follow the plan. Work on a first file and do as much as possible before moving to the next.

## Code

**Step 1 & 2: Single File Parsing and Basic Information Extraction**

**Created:** A simple Python file to test with (e.g., `test_file.py`):

**Created:** The Python code to parse test file to extract basic information (`parser.py`)

This Python code analyzes a given Python file (test_file.py) and extracts information about its structure, including imports, classes, and functions.

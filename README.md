# Codebase-Grapher

## Goals & Use Cases

I want to reduce frustration in certain situations. VSCode extension, **CodeGPT**’s knowledge graph visualization showed me how game-changing this tool can be. After experiencing it, I don’t want to go back—but the trial was limited to one codebase.

I know this is a complex project, far beyond my current level. However, I’m eager to learn how it works and challenge myself to see what I can achieve on this journey.

Wish me luck!

- **Phase 1** is half-done with the completed parser script. Using AST, analyze a Python file, and extract classes, functions, methods, and dependencies. Exports a JSON file.  

## Features Planned

### Codebase Understanding

* Quickly grasp the structure of a new or old project.
* Visually explore file interactions, dependencies, and key components.

### AI-Assisted Development Context Management

* Keep AI coding assistants focused on only the relevant parts of the project for a given task.
* Reduce context size while maintaining accuracy in AI-generated suggestions.

### Up-to-Date Project Documentation

* Automate project documentation updates as the code evolves.
* Improve maintainability as projects grow in size and complexity.

# Codebase-Grapher

## Goals & Use Cases

I want to reduce frustration in certain situations. VSCode extension, **CodeGPT**’s knowledge graph visualization showed me how game-changing this tool can be. After experiencing it, I don’t want to go back—but the trial was limited to one codebase.

I know this is a complex project, far beyond my current level. However, I’m eager to learn how it works and challenge myself to see what I can achieve on this journey.

Wish me luck!

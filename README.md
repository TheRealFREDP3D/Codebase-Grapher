# Codebase-Grapher

## Goals & Use Cases

I want to facilitate working on Python projects in certain situations. 

Since I tried the VSCode extension, **CodeGPT**’s knowledge graph visualization showed me how game-changing and time-saving this tool can be. After experiencing it, I don’t want to go back without it.  The extension trial was limited to only one codebase and as a hobbyist developer, I don't have a budget for subscription tooling.

I know this is a complex task, far beyond my current level. However, I’m eager to learn how it works under the hood.

I am always looking for a good challenge and I am ready to see what I can achieve on this journey.

Wish me luck!

## Updates

17-01-2025

- **Phase 1** is half-done with the completed parser script. Using AST, analyze a Python file, and extract classes, functions, methods, and dependencies. Exports a JSON file.  

## Features Planned

### Codebase Understanding

* Quickly grasp the structure of a new or old project.
* Visually explore file interactions, dependencies, and key components.

### AI-Assisted Development Context Management

* Keep AI coding assistants focused on only the relevant parts of the project for a given task.
* Reduce context size while maintaining accuracy in AI-generated suggestions.

### Up-to-Date Project Documentation

* Automate project documentation updates as the code evolves.
* Improve maintainability as projects grow in size and complexity.

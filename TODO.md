# TODO

Next things to work on:

1. **Phase 1, Step 1 & 2:** Focus on directory traversal and basic AST parsing of a single Python file. Get comfortable with the `ast` module.
2. **Phase 1, Step 3 & 4 (Basic Listing):** Implement the information extraction for classes, functions, and imports, and output a simple structured listing (e.g., print to console or save to a JSON file).
3. **Experiment with `networkx`:** Create a simple graph manually in `networkx` and experiment with basic drawing to get familiar with the library.

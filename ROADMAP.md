# CodeGrapher

**Where to Begin: A Phased Approach**

It's best to tackle this project in phases, starting with the core functionality and then expanding.

## **Phase 1: Core Analysis & Basic Listing**

* **Goal:** Parse Python code, create a structured representation of file contents (modules, classes, functions), and output a basic listing.
* **Key Technologies:**
  * **`ast` module (Python's Abstract Syntax Tree):** This is your foundation. The `ast` module allows you to parse Python code into a tree-like structure representing its syntax. You can then traverse this tree to extract information.
  * **Python Standard Library (`os`, `pathlib`):** For file system navigation and handling project directories.
  * **Basic Data Structures (Dictionaries, Lists):** To store the extracted information in a structured way.

* **Steps:**
    1. **Directory Traversal:** Use `os.walk` or `pathlib.Path.rglob` to recursively traverse the project directory and identify Python files (`.py`).
    2. **AST Parsing:** For each Python file:
        * Read the file content.
        * Use `ast.parse(source_code)` to get the AST.
    3. **Information Extraction:**
        * **Module/File Level:** Extract the filename/path.
        * **Class Definitions:** Traverse the AST to find `ast.ClassDef` nodes. Extract class names, methods (using `ast.FunctionDef` within class bodies), and potentially docstrings.
        * **Function Definitions (Top-Level):** Traverse the AST to find top-level `ast.FunctionDef` nodes. Extract function names, parameters, and docstrings.
        * **Imports:** Traverse the AST to find `ast.Import` and `ast.ImportFrom` nodes. Extract imported modules and names.
    4. **Structured Listing Output:** Output the extracted information in a structured format (e.g., JSON, YAML, or even a simple text-based tree). This could be a nested dictionary representing the project structure.

* **Example Output (Conceptual JSON):**

```json
{
  "project_name": "my_project",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "module1.py",
      "classes": [
        {
          "name": "MyClass",
          "methods": ["method1", "method2"],
          "docstring": "Class docstring..."
        }
      ],
      "functions": ["top_function"],
      "imports": ["os", "module2"]
    },
    {
      "path": "module2.py",
      "classes": [],
      "functions": ["another_function"],
      "imports": []
    }
  ]
}
```

## **Phase 2: Relationship Identification (Imports, Dependencies, Calls)**

* **Goal:** Identify and represent relationships between files, focusing on imports, dependencies, and function calls.
* **Key Technologies (Building on Phase 1):**
  * **`ast` module (continued):** Deeper analysis of the AST.
  * **Graph Data Structure (e.g., `networkx`):** Excellent Python library for creating, manipulating, and analyzing graphs. This is ideal for representing relationships.

* **Steps (Building on Phase 1):**
    1. **Import Relationship Extraction (Enhanced):**
        * In Phase 1, you extracted imported modules. Now, determine *which* file imports *which*. This becomes an edge in your graph.
    2. **Function Call Graph (Within Files):**
        * Traverse function bodies (`ast.FunctionDef`) and class method bodies (`ast.FunctionDef` within `ast.ClassDef`).
        * Look for `ast.Call` nodes.
        * Resolve function calls to their definitions (within the same file initially). This is more complex, but you can start with simple name matching.
    3. **Inter-File Function Call Graph (Advanced - Iterative):**
        * After building the intra-file call graph, extend it to inter-file calls. This requires resolving function calls across modules based on import statements. It can be iterative and become quite sophisticated.
    4. **Dependency Graph:** Create a graph where nodes are files/modules, and edges represent "depends on" (e.g., module A imports module B, so A depends on B).
    5. **Graph Representation using `networkx`:**
        * Create `networkx.Graph` or `networkx.DiGraph` objects to represent your relationships.
        * Nodes in the graph can be files, classes, or functions (depending on the level of detail you want to visualize).
        * Edges can represent imports, function calls, or dependencies.
        * Store relevant attributes on nodes and edges (e.g., file path, function name, import type).

## **Phase 3: Interactive Visualization**

* **Goal:** Visualize the graph data interactively, allowing users to explore the codebase structure and relationships.
* **Key Technologies:**
  * **Graph Visualization Libraries:**
    * **`networkx` (basic drawing):** `networkx` has basic drawing capabilities using Matplotlib, but it's not ideal for interactive visualizations.
    * **`graphviz` (and `pygraphviz` or `pydot`):** Excellent for generating static graph layouts (DOT language). Can be made interactive with web frameworks.
    * **Web-based Libraries (JavaScript + Python Backend):**
      * **`vis.js` (JavaScript):** Powerful and interactive graph visualization library. Can be integrated with Python backends (e.g., using Flask or Django to serve graph data as JSON).
      * **`d3.js` (JavaScript):** Highly flexible data visualization library. More complex to use directly for graph visualization but very powerful.
      * **`plotly` (Python):** Can create interactive graphs in Python and embed them in web applications or notebooks.
      * **`dash` (Python, built on Plotly):** Framework for building interactive web applications with visualizations, ideal for this project.

* **Steps:**
    1. **Graph Layout:** Use graph layout algorithms from `networkx` (or libraries like `graphviz`) to arrange the nodes in a visually meaningful way (e.g., hierarchical layout, force-directed layout).
    2. **Visualization Implementation:**
        * **Static Images (using `graphviz` or `networkx`):** Generate images of the graph for a simple, non-interactive output.
        * **Interactive Web Visualization (using `vis.js`, `plotly/dash`):**
            * Create a web application (e.g., using Flask or Dash).
            * Use Python to generate graph data in JSON format (nodes and edges with attributes) from your `networkx` graph.
            * Use JavaScript (with `vis.js` or similar) or Python (`plotly/dash`) in the frontend to render the graph.
            * Implement interactivity: zooming, panning, node selection, edge highlighting, displaying node/edge information on click/hover.

## **Phase 4: AI Context Management & Documentation (Integration)**

* **Goal:** Leverage the analysis and visualization for AI context management and automated documentation.
* **Key Technologies (Building on previous phases):**
  * **API for Data Access:** Expose your analysis data (graph, structured listing) through an API (e.g., REST API using Flask/FastAPI).
  * **Documentation Generation Tools (e.g., Sphinx):** Integrate with existing documentation tools.
  * **AI Tool Integration (Conceptual):** Define interfaces for AI tools to consume your analysis data.

* **Steps:**
    1. **API Development:** Create an API to:
        * Retrieve the structured listing of the project.
        * Query the graph (e.g., "get dependencies of module X," "find functions called by function Y").
        * Export the graph data in different formats (JSON, GraphML, etc.).
    2. **AI Context Management Integration (Conceptual):**
        * Design how AI tools can use your API to:
            * **Filter context:** Given a task related to a specific file or function, query the API to get related files (dependencies, callers, etc.). Provide only this relevant subset to the AI.
            * **Visualize context:** Use your visualization to show the AI user the relevant parts of the project related to their current task.
    3. **Documentation Integration:**
        * **Automatic Project Summary:** Use your analysis to generate an overview of the project structure (e.g., list of modules, key classes, dependencies).
        * **Augmenting Docstrings:** Potentially link docstrings to the visualization or provide visual representations of function call flows within documentation.
        * **Dependency Diagrams in Documentation:** Generate dependency diagrams and include them in project documentation (e.g., using Sphinx extensions).

## **Best Practices:**

* **Modular Design:** Break your system into modules (analysis, graph building, visualization, API). This will make it easier to develop, test, and maintain.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for parsing and graph construction. Codebases can have variations and edge cases.
* **Testing:** Write unit tests for your analysis and graph generation components.
* **Progressive Enhancement:** Start with basic functionality and gradually add more features and complexity.
* **User Experience:** Think about how users will interact with the visualization. Make it intuitive and informative.
* **Performance:** For large codebases, consider performance implications of parsing and graph construction. Optimize where needed.

## **Integration with AI-Assisted Coding Tools (Conceptual)**

* **API-Based Integration:** The most flexible approach is to expose your system's functionality through an API. AI tools can then consume this API to get project structure and relationship information.
* **Plugin/Extension Development:** Depending on the AI coding tool, you might be able to develop a plugin or extension that directly integrates with your system.
* **Data Export/Import:** Allow exporting the analysis data in standard formats that AI tools might be able to import (e.g., JSON, GraphML).

## **Where to Start *Right Now***

1. **Phase 1, Step 1 & 2:** Focus on directory traversal and basic AST parsing of a single Python file. Get comfortable with the `ast` module.
2. **Phase 1, Step 3 & 4 (Basic Listing):** Implement the information extraction for classes, functions, and imports, and output a simple structured listing (e.g., print to console or save to a JSON file).
3. **Experiment with `networkx`:** Create a simple graph manually in `networkx` and experiment with basic drawing to get familiar with the library.

## **Conclusion**

This is a complex project, but by breaking it down into phases and focusing on building solid foundations, I believe this could become a valuable tool.
